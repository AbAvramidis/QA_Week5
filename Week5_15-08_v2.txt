Package A depends on Package B if B absolutely must be installed in order to run A. In some cases, A depends not only on B, but on a version of B. In this case, the version dependency is usually a lower limit, in the sense that A depends on any version of B more recent than some specified version.

Package A recommends Package B, if the package maintainer judges that most users would not want A without also having the functionality provided by B.

Package A suggests Package B if B contains files that are related to (and usually enhance) the functionality of A.
